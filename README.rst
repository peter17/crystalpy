Crystalpy is a Python program which can generate 2D periodic crystal mesh geometries for Gmsh.

It can also generate SVG representations of those geometries.

Several types of inclusions can be defined (filled or not with a material).

Versions

* v. 1:		Can generate periodic 2D meshes, with multiple inclusion types
* v. 1.1:	Add support for SVG output
